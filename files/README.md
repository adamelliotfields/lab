# `README`

Welcome to the [`lab`](https://aef.me/lab/lab/index.html) ðŸ§ª

This is a [JupyterLite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) instance hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/adamelliotfields/lab).

For [me](https://aef.me/about/), it's an easy-to-remember place to keep my Python notes. You can use it, or host your own!

## What is it?

This is [JupyerLab](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) running in your browser. Some remote files are fetched to run the app, but nothing is executed on a server.

It uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/index.html), which is CPython ported to WebAssembly.

## How do I use it?

Read my notebooks (in the file explorer on the left). Edit them and they'll be saved in your browser. Run the code cells. Add new packages with `%pip install`.

You can even create new files and download them to your computer if you want. Try changing the theme in the `Settings` menu up top. Check out [JupyterLab Night](https://github.com/martinRenou/jupyterlab-night).

## Where do I get it?

Follow the canonical example in the [demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo) repo, which [my](https://github.com/adamelliotfields/lab) repo is based on.
